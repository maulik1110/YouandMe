          <h2>✨ How We Met</h2>
          <p>
            A random cricket match made it possible for both of us to break the
            ice and begin our first interaction. I still have those videos of
            you, playing cricket and bringing smile on the face.

          <p>
            We laughed, we talked, we played games, we enjoyed the company. Most
            importantly, we got comfortable knowing eachother and exchanged the
            smile, exchanged the happiness, exchanged the memories, and created
            a group. We almost talked for 4 hours.

          <p>
            Began to exchange the snaps, talking via snap was something very interesting and new. Sharing cute little daily activities, making bond even better for one another. That was cute but but your mom is more cute

          <p>
            We really cared for each other, late night talks, me irritating you with demand to meet(Overaction), bcz my past was in such a way that i prefer meeting people who is close to me. But, we had a good time to know each other. You also stood when i needed you and likewise.

          <p>
            I was the priority, WAS. Anytime call, pictures, updates, etc. It was soo good. I was obsessed with US. I just respect you soo much idk why but I do. I am insecure sometimes but thats who I am. I want my people to keep me as priority. MY PEOPLE.

          <h2>Fights</h2>
          <p>
            Yupe, we fought, Ik you were't sure whether you want me or not. Was it a TP or was it genuine from your end, IDK. I felt i was an option, not the priority. I hate being an option. Lately, you took me for granted(You said this to me). It felt sop bad at that time.

          <p>
            It all changed after the Diwali Fight. Tu ruthti thi main manata tha, Not because I can't live without you ya main tere peeche pada hu, But it was more of respect and value that I have for you. But even after that, we aren't same anymore. I still am the same but you aren't. Your reason for not talking seems like an excuese to ignore me. And UK that you are ignoring me and I am no more a person you want in your life. I better feel to exit, but then I feel lets try ONE MORE TIME
